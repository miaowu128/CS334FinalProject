### Team-menber: Helen Zeng, Julian Zhao, Olivia Song.

The pipline is Data Cleaning -> Feature Engineering -> Model1 -> Model 2 -> Model 3 -> Comparison.

After running Data Cleaning notebook, you will get a "pubg.csv" file, which is used in the following steps.
For your convinience, we include feature engineering code at the begining of the code for each model, so that you could run the notebooks for the three model seperately. We seperate the notebooks by model so that each of us can run a part, which means the training data sample in same models can be different. Considering that the sample size is large enough, this difference is not taken into account.
